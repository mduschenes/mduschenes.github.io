## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Quantum Information, with the late Raymond Laflamme, and Roger Melko at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, and Juan Carrasquilla at ETH.

I am currently studying the relationships between physical phenomena and computational approaches, develop numerical methods, and am excited about teaching and sharing these ideas.

I'm a passionate learner and teacher, with experience in developing course content, guest lecturing, and academic outreach, in physics, machine-learning, and statistics disciplines.
