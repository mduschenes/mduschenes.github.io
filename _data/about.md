I am a PhD candidate in Quantum Information, with Raymond Laflamme at the Institute for Quantum Computing of the University of Waterloo, and Juan Carrasquilla at ETH, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

I am currently studying the relationships between physical phenomena and computational approaches, develop numerical methods, and am passionate about teaching and sharing these ideas.
